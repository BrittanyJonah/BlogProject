### Getting Started
 
I built this blog as a summer project to add to my <a href="https://brittanyjonah.com" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>. I had a lot of fun creating this blog and I hope you find some useful information here as it continues to grow.
                  


<h3>About Bits Of Britt</h3>
  <p class="lead">
      Summer of 2021 I decided to build a blog that I could use to share helpful tips and tricks I've learned in different aspects of my life. I love Programming and Technology, and recently have gotten into Fitness, Nutrition and overall Health as well and am excited
      to share my experiences in these subjects with you. Here are some of the topics I plan to write about:
  </p>

  <ul>
      <li>Coding: 'How to's, Interesting info, walkthroughs, guides and more</li>
      <li>Technology: Cool new tech, things I am working with/building, etc</li>
      <li>Fitness: Workouts, Resources, My experiences, advice and more</li>
      <li>Nutrition: Recipes, food logs, interesting facts, personal experiences, etc</li>
  </ul>

### Hi there, I'm Brittany ðŸ‘‹

### I'm a Developer, Lifelong Student and Content Creator!
- ðŸ”­ I'm Currently working on A Bug Tracker App using C#
- ðŸŒ± I'm Currently learning Angular & AWS
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate with other developers
- ðŸ¥… 2021 Goals: Get a full-time Position as a Software Developer
- âš¡ Fun Fact: I love to design and play video games!

<h4>About Me</h4>
<p>I am a motivated professional with software development, programming, and UX/UI design experience. Recognized for demonstrating a natural aptitude for developing and delivering exceptional digital experiences, as well as for ensuring optimal code quality and efficiently resolving issues, I have a strong passion for translating and transforming visions and concepts into web-based products. As such, I have consistently exceeded project goals and I am adept at ensuring that solutions are directly aligned with client needs. Professional focal points include software development, UX/UI design, programming, Agile/Waterfall methodology, front-end development, problem solving, object-oriented programming, web development, product evolution, application development, and task prioritization. Delivering superior administration on the latter areas of expertise requires utilization of effective communication skills, critical thinking skills, as well as professional acumen, strategic planning, project management and resource management to support efficiency and maximum returns.
<br><br>
Recently, I graduated from Coder Foundry Bootcamp. During this time, I gained experience with coding, software/front-end development, object-oriented programming, and more. I also improved my knowledge of C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap5, and other tools/languages. Prior to this, I worked as a Sales and Services Agent with RBC Advice Center where I was responsible for developing solutions to meet the financial needs of diverse clients.
 <br><br>
 Colleagues describe me as a progressive, driven, down-to-earth, technical and innovative expert who can be relied on to offer superior solutions that deliver impactful results on time and under budget.
<br><br />
